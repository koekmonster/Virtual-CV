This File contains two files called index.html and styles.css

The index.html file is the actual website code to visit the CV, and the styles.css file just styles the CV in the way you want it to look.
I personally used visual studio code to create the website.

Steps:In visual studio code
1.Create a new folder
2.Create a new file under that folder
3.Name the one index.html or any name.html
4.Create anothe file called styles.css
5.paste relevant code and you have created the Website.

After this is done, the website is created and can be opened on any browser or on another device.
